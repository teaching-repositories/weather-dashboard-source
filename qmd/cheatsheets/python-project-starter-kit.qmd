## Project Structure

1. **Create a new directory** for your project and navigate into it.
2. **Create a `src` or `scripts` directory** for your Python scripts.
3. **Create a `notebooks` directory** for your Jupyter Notebooks.
4. **Create a `requirements.txt` file** to manage dependencies.
5. **Create a `README.md` file** to describe your project.

## Notebook Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful notebook names**.
2. **Organize notebooks into sections** (e.g., introduction, methods, results).
3. **Use clear and concise headings**.
4. **Use Markdown** for formatting.
5. **Keep notebooks concise** and focused on a single idea.

## Script Best Practices

1. **Use meaningful script names**.
2. **Keep scripts short and focused** (e.g., < 50 lines).
3. **Use clear and concise variable names**.
4. **Use comments to explain code**.
5. **Test scripts regularly** using print statements or a testing framework.

## Code Style

1. **Use a consistent coding style** (e.g., PEP 8).
2. **Use meaningful variable names**.
3. **Use type hints** for function arguments and return types.
4. **Use consistent indentation** (4 spaces).
5. **Avoid magic numbers**; use named constants instead.

## Testing

1. **Test scripts regularly** using print statements or a testing framework.
2. **Use a testing framework** (e.g., unittest) for more complex scripts.
3. **Test for edge cases** and **error handling**.

## Best Practices

1. **Use version control** (e.g., Git) to track changes.
2. **Use a code editor** with syntax highlighting.
3. **Use a linter** (e.g., flake8) to catch errors.
4. **Keep your code organized** and **maintainable**.
5. **Collaborate with others** and **ask for help** when needed.
