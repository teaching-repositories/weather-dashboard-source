So let's get started!

## What is Git?

Git is a free and open-source tool that helps you manage and track changes to your code. It's like a digital notebook where you can save and organize your work.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a website where you can store and share your Git projects. It's like a big library where you can store and share your code with others.

## Key Git Commands:

1. **git init**: Initializes a new Git repository in your project directory.
2. **git add <file>**: Adds a new file to the Git repository.
3. **git commit -m "commit message"**: Saves changes to the repository with a brief description.
4. **git log**: Shows a history of all commits made to the repository.
5. **git status**: Checks the status of the repository, showing which files have changed.
6. **git push**: Sends changes from your local repository to the GitHub repository.
7. **git pull**: Fetches changes from the GitHub repository and merges them with your local changes.

## Key GitHub Concepts:

1. **Repository (Repo)**: A collection of files and folders stored on GitHub.
2. **Branch**: A separate version of your repository, allowing you to work on different features or fixes.
3. **Commit**: A snapshot of your changes, saved to the repository.
4. **Pull Request**: A request to merge changes from one branch to another.

## Basic Git Workflow:

1. **Create a new repository**: Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory using `git init`.
2. **Make changes**: Edit files and add new ones to your project.
3. **Commit changes**: Save changes to the repository using `git commit -m "commit message"`.
4. **Push changes**: Send changes to the GitHub repository using `git push`.
5. **Pull changes**: Fetch changes from the GitHub repository and merge them with your local changes using `git pull`.

## Tips and Tricks:

* Always commit changes regularly to avoid losing work.
* Use descriptive commit messages to help track changes.
* Use `git status` to check the status of your repository.
* Use `git log` to view the history of commits.
* Use `git pull` and `git push` to synchronize your local and remote repositories.

## Common Mistakes:

* Forgetting to commit changes before pushing to GitHub.
* Not using descriptive commit messages.
* Not pulling changes from the remote repository regularly.
