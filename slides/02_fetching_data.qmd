* Demonstrate how to use the `json` library to parse JSON data in Python
* Highlight the importance of data parsing and how it is used in the weather dashboard project

# Error Handling

* Introduce the concept of error handling in Python and its importance
* Demonstrate how to use try-except blocks to handle errors in Python
* Highlight the importance of error handling in the weather dashboard project

# Breakout Room Activity

* Emphasise the importance of teamwork and collaboration in the project
* Encourage students to work together to fetch and parse data for different cities

# Demo and Discussion

* Demonstrate how to use the fetched data to create a basic weather dashboard
* Encourage students to share their findings and discuss challenges

# Q&A and Wrap-Up

* Address any questions and provide additional tips
