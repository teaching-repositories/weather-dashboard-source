::: {.notes}
This slide provides a foundational understanding of the essential operations in Python programming, setting the stage for deeper exploration into each concept throughout the presentation.

- **Importance of Sequential Execution:**
  - **Sequential Flow:** Programming languages execute instructions in sequence, one after another.
  - **Logical Order:** Emphasise that understanding and controlling sequential execution is fundamental to programming logic.
  - **Control Flow:** Introduce the concept of control flow and how it dictates the order in which instructions are executed.
  - Sequential execution ensures that instructions are carried out in the intended order, laying the foundation for logical flow within a program.
  - Understanding sequential execution helps programmers predict and debug program behavior effectively.

- **Introduction to Six Fundamental Operations:**
  - Each operation represents a fundamental capability that forms the basis of all computer programs.
  - **1. Input:** Gathering data into the program.
    - Example: Using `input()` function to receive user input.
  - **2. Output:** Displaying results or information.
    - Example: Using `print()` function to output data to the console.
  - **3. Calculation:** Performing mathematical operations.
    - Example: Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
  - **4. Store Things (Assignment):** Storing data in variables.
    - Example: Assigning values to variables (`x = 10`).
  - **5. Make Decisions (If/Then):** Executing different actions based on conditions.
    - Example: Using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to control program flow.
  - **6. Going Loopy (for, while):** Repeating tasks iteratively.
    - Example: Implementing `for` loops to iterate over lists or `while` loops to repeat until a condition is met.

:::

# Input Operations

- Import from console `input()`
- Import from File
- Input from Database

```python
input("Enter today's temperature in Celsius: ")
```


# Output Operations

- Output to console `print()`
- Output to File
- Output to Database
- Output to plot/chart (screen/file)

```python
print("Today's temperature in Celsius is 27.8")
```

# Data Representation and Types

- Computers store and process data using binary digits (0s and 1s).
- Binary representation forms the basis for all data manipulation and storage in computers.
- **Data Types:** Define the kind of data stored (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
- **Interpretation:** Determines how the computer interprets and manipulates binary data.
- **Foundation:** Essential for understanding how variables store and interact with data.
- **Operations:** Different data types support different operations (e.g., arithmetic, string manipulation).
- **Integer:** Represents whole numbers (`5`, `-10`).
- **String:** Represents sequences of characters (`"Hello"`, `'Python'`).
- **Universal Concept:** Applies across all programming languages.
- **Adaptability:** Understanding data types aids in adapting to different languages and environments.


# Calculation Operations
- Basic Arithmetic Operations
  - `+, -, *, /. //, %`
- Combine for complex calculations
- Boolean (True/False) operators
  - Relational Operators:  `<, >, <=, >=`
  - Logical Operators: `and, or, not`

# Store/Assignment
- Variables: Values and Types
- Assignment/Update operator: `=`
  
```python
temperature = input("Enter today's temperature in Celsius: ")
print(f"Today's temperature is {temperature}")
temperature = input("Enter tomorrows's temperature in Celsius: ")
```

# Conversion to number
- All keyboard input is a string
- Convert to number

```python
temperature = input("Enter today's temperature in Celsius: ")
temperature = float(temperature)  # Convert input to float
```

# Validate input
- try/catch
- test positive/negative
- assert statements
- Lib/Package: PyInputPlus

```python
try:
    temperature = float(temperature)  # Convert input to float
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
```


# Decision Making (If/Then Structures)
- Boolean Expressions
-  Relational Operators:  `<, >, <=, >=`
-  Logical Operators: `and, or, not`
- Simple `if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else` Statements


# Decision Example

```python
temperature = input("Enter today's temperature in Celsius: ")
temperature = float(temperature)  # Convert input to float

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day!")
elif temperature < 10:
    print("It's a cold day.")
else:
    print("It's a moderate day.")
```


# Repetition (Loops)
- `for` Loops
- `while` Loops
- list/dictionary comprehension
- Nested Loops (Conceptual)
- recursion


# `for` Loops

`for` loops are used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects. The basic syntax is:
```python
for variable in iterable:
    # code to be executed
```
Here, `variable` takes on the value of each element in the `iterable` object, and the code inside the loop is executed for each iteration.

# `for` Loop Example:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
Output:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

#  `while` Loops

`while` loops are used to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The basic syntax is:
```python
while condition:
    # code to be executed
```
Here, the code inside the loop is executed as long as the `condition` is true.

# `while` Loop Example:
```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```
Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```
#  List/Dictionary Comprehension

List and dictionary comprehensions are concise ways to create new lists or dictionaries from existing iterables. The basic syntax is:
```python
new_list = [expression for element in iterable]
new_dict = {key: value for element in iterable}
```
Here, `expression` is evaluated for each element in the `iterable`, and the results are collected in a new list or dictionary.

# Comprehension Example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in numbers]
print(squared_numbers)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

# Nested Loops

Nested loops are loops that are contained within another loop. This allows you to iterate over multiple iterables simultaneously.

Example:
```python
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
```
Output:
```
i: 0, j: 0
i: 0, j: 1
i: 1, j: 0
i: 1, j: 1
i: 2, j: 0
i: 2, j: 1
```

# Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a base case is reached. The basic syntax is:
```python
def function(arg):
    if base_case:
        return result
    else:
        return function(arg)
```
Here, the function calls itself with a new argument until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns a result.

# Recursion Example
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
print(factorial(5))  # 120
```


# Managing Complexity with Functions
1. **Code Reusability**: You can write a function once and use it multiple times throughout your program, reducing code duplication.
2. **Modularity**: Functions help organise your code into smaller, independent units that are easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Abstraction**: Functions can hide complex logic and implementation details, making it easier to use them without worrying about the inner workings.

# Function Components and Syntax

1. **Function Name**: A unique name given to the function, which is used to call it.
2. **Parameters**: Optional values that are passed to the function when it's called. Parameters are used to customise the function's behavior.
3. **Return Statement**: An optional statement that returns a value from the function.
4. **Function Body**: The code that's executed when the function is called.

# Function example
```python
def greet(name) {
  print(f'Hello, {name}!')
}

greet("John") # Output: Hello, John!
```

# Best Practices for Writing Functions

1. **Keep it Simple**: Functions should perform a single, well-defined task.
2. **Use Meaningful Names**: Choose function names that clearly indicate what the function does.
3. **Use Parameters**: Pass parameters to customise the function's behavior.
4. **Return Values**: Use return statements to provide useful values to the caller.
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Write tests to ensure your functions work correctly and handle edge cases.


# Data Structures: Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries and Sets
- Tuples: storing immutable values
- Lists: Storing Sequences of Values
- Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs for Data Organisation
- Sets: Storing unique values


## Tuples: Storing Immutable Values**

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Trying to modify the tuple will raise a TypeError
my_tuple[0] = 10  # Raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```
# Lists: Storing Sequences of Values**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Modifying the list is allowed
my_list.append(6)
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

# *Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs for Data Organisation**

```python
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}

# Accessing values using keys
print(my_dict["name"])  # Output: John
print(my_dict["age"])  # Output: 30

# Modifying values is allowed
my_dict["age"] = 31
print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 31, 'city': 'New York'}
```

# Sets: Storing Unique Values**

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Adding a duplicate value will not change the set
my_set.add(5)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Removing a value is allowed
my_set.remove(3)
print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}
```



**Lists: Storing Sequences of Values**

A List in Python is a collection of items that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists. Lists are denoted by square brackets `[]` and are ordered, meaning that the order of items matters.

# Common List operations

* **Indexing**: Allows accessing specific elements using their position in the data structure. Only lists support indexing.
* **Slicing**: Allows extracting a subset of elements from a list. Only lists support slicing.
* **Append**: Adds new elements to the end of a list. Only lists support appending.
* **Insert**: Inserts new elements at a specific position in a list. Only lists support inserting.
* **Remove**: Removes elements from a list. Only lists support removing.

# Examples
* Indexing: `my_list[0]` returns the first element of the list.
* Slicing: `my_list[1:3]` returns the elements at indices 1 and 2.
* Append: `my_list.append("new element")` adds a new element to the end of the list.
* Insert: `my_list.insert(1, "new element")` inserts a new element at index 1.
* Remove: `my_list.remove("old element")` removes the first occurrence of the element "old element" from the list.

`Note that tuples, dictionaries, and sets do not support these operations. Tuples are immutable, dictionaries are key-value pairs, and sets are unordered collections of unique elements.`

# Problem Solving Framework
- Understand the problem
- Identify input/output
- Work the problem by hand (early test cases)
- Write pseudo code and convert to python
- Test with variety of data

# **Understand the Problem**
	* Read and re-read the problem statement to ensure you understand what is being asked.
	* Identify the key elements of the problem, including:
		+ Inputs: What data will the program need to solve the problem?
		+ Outputs: What results should the program produce?
		+ Constraints: Are there any limitations or rules that the program must follow?
#  **Identify Input/Output**
	* Determine the types and formats of the input data.
	* Identify the expected output format and any specific requirements (e.g., precision, formatting).
#  **Work the Problem by Hand (Early Test Cases)**
	* Choose a few simple test cases to work through by hand.
	* Verify that your manual calculations produce the expected output.
	* This step helps you understand the problem better and identify any potential issues.
#  **Write Pseudo Code and Convert to Python**
	* Write pseudo code to describe the steps your program will take to solve the problem.
	* Convert the pseudo code to Python, using a top-down approach to structure your code.
	* Focus on one component at a time, and make sure each part is working correctly before moving on to the next.
# **Test with Variety of Data**
	* Write test cases to verify that your program produces the expected output for a variety of input data.
	* Use a range of inputs, including edge cases and unusual data, to ensure your program is robust and reliable.
	* Test your program in different environments and configurations to ensure it works as expected.


# **Step 1 - Understand the Problem**
Let's go through each step to develop a simple program to convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius.

* Define the Problem: Kelvin to Celsius Conversion

The problem is to write a program that takes a temperature in Kelvin as input and returns the equivalent temperature in Celsius.  This is simple, but in real life probably interview the client, do some independent research, caht to experts, read research papers, study existing programs etc.

# **Step 2 - Define Inputs and Outputs**

* Input: Kelvin Temperature (a single number, e.g., 273.15)
* Output: Celsius Temperature (a single number, e.g., 0.15)

# **Step 3 - Work the Problem by Hand**

* Manual Calculation Example:

> Let's convert 273.15 Kelvin to Celsius. We know that the conversion formula is:
>
> Celsius = Kelvin - 273.15
>
> So, we subtract 273.15 from 273.15 to get:
> 
> Celsius = 0.15

This manual calculation shows that the program should subtract 273.15 from the input Kelvin temperature to get the equivalent Celsius temperature.

# **Step 4 - Write Pseudo Code**

This pseudo code defines the algorithm for the conversion. It takes the input Kelvin temperature, subtracts 273.15, and prints the result.

```
input_kelvin = get kelvin temperature
celsius = input_kelvin - 273.15
print celsius
```

```python
input_kelvin = input("Please input temperature in Kelvin")
celsius = input_kelvin - 273.15
print(celsius)
```


# **Step 5 - Test with Data**

* Test Cases: Valid and Invalid Inputs

Valid Inputs:

* 273.15 Kelvin -> 0.15 Celsius
* 0 Kelvin -> -273.15 Celsius
* 500 Kelvin -> 226.85 Celsius

Invalid Inputs:

* Negative Kelvin (e.g., -273.15) -> Error handling needed
* Non-numeric input (e.g., "abc") -> Error handling needed

Handling Edge Cases (Negative Kelvin):

* We'll add error handling to handle negative Kelvin inputs. For example, we could print an error message and return an error code.


# Final Python program:
```python
def kelvin_to_celsius(kelvin):
    if kelvin < 0:
        print("Error: Negative Kelvin temperature")
        return None
    celsius = kelvin - 273.15
    return celsius

# Test cases
print(kelvin_to_celsius(273.15))  # 0.15
print(kelvin_to_celsius(0))  # -273.15
print(kelvin_to_celsius(500))  # 226.85

# Invalid inputs
print(kelvin_to_celsius(-273.15))  # Error: Negative Kelvin temperature
print(kelvin_to_celsius("abc"))  # Error: Non-numeric input
```

# Introduction to Version Control with GitHub

- Keeps track of changes made
- Allows for easy collaboration
- Provides a backup of code
- Helps resolve conflicts
- Improves code quality
- Git:  local command line version control
- GitHub: Web-based platform for version control


# File Input/Output Operations

File input/output operations allow your program to read and write data to files on the file system.

Python has several built-in functions for working with files, including:

* `open()` to open a file
* `read()` to read the contents of a file
* `write()` to write data to a file
* `close()` to close a file

# File I/O Example
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    print(file.read())
```

Note: The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed, even if an exception is thrown.


# Introduction to Databases**

A database is a collection of organised data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. In programming, databases are used to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Python has several libraries for working with databases, including:

* `sqlite3` for SQLite databases
* `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL databases
* `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL databases

# Database Example
```python
import sqlite3

# Create a connection to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect("example.db")

# Create a cursor object
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE users (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        email TEXT
    );
""")

# Insert some data
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com')")

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```


# Data Visualisation**

1. **Data**: The raw information being visualised.
2. **Visualisation**: The graphical representation of the data.
3. **Chart type**: The specific type of visualisation used, such as bar charts, line charts, or scatter plots.
4. **Aesthetics**: The visual elements used to enhance the visualisation, such as colors, fonts, and layouts.
5. **Interactivity**: The ability to interact with the visualisation, such as sooming, hovering, or clicking.

# Matplotlib

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Create the figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the data
ax.plot(x, y)

# Set the title and labels
ax.set_title('Simple Line Chart')
ax.set_xlabel('X Axis')
ax.set_ylabel('Y Axis')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

#  Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves sending an HTTP request to a website, receiving the HTML response, and then parsing the HTML to extract the desired data. Web scraping is useful for data mining, data analysis, and automation.


# Simple Web Scrape Example
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Send an HTTP request to the website
url = "https://www.example.com"
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the HTML response using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, "html.parser")

# Find all the links on the webpage
links = soup.find_all("a")
for link in links:
    print(link.get("href"))
```

# Web Scraping Tips

* Always check the website's terms of use and robots.txt file to make sure web scraping is allowed.
* Be respectful of the website and don't overload it with requests.
* Handle errors and exceptions properly.
* Use a user agent to identify yourself and avoid being blocked.
* Consider using a proxy server to hide your IP address.



# API - Application Programming Interface

APIs are a set of defined rules that enables different applications, services, or systems to communicate with each other. It allows data to be shared, processed, and used by different systems, making it a crucial part of modern software development.

**Basics of APIs**

Here are some key concepts to understand about APIs:

* **API Type**: There are several types of APIs, including:
	+ **Web API**: A web API is an API that is accessed over the web, typically using HTTP requests and responses.
	+ **RESTful API**: A RESTful API is a type of web API that follows the REST (Representational State of Resource) architecture.
	+ **SOAP API**: A SOAP API is a type of web API that uses the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) protocol.
* **API Endpoint**: An API endpoint is a specific URL that is used to access a particular resource or functionality.
* **API Request**: An API request is a request sent to an API endpoint to retrieve or modify data.
* **API Response**: An API response is the data returned by the API in response to an API request.
* **API Key**: An API key is a unique string of characters that is used to authenticate and authorise API requests.

# Web API Example

**API Endpoint**: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`
**API Request**: `GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`
**API Response**:
```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```

# Web API Python Code
```python
import requests

# Send a GET request to the API endpoint
response = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")

# Check if the response was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
```

# API Tips

* Always check the API documentation to understand the available endpoints, request methods, and response formats.

Here's an introduction to GUIs with Tkinter, including the basics and a simple GUI example:

**Introduction to GUIs with Tkinter**

Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to Tk and is bundled with most standard Python distributions.

**Basics of Graphical User Interfaces**

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a computer program using visual elements such as windows, buttons, and menus. GUIs are designed to be more intuitive and user-friendly than command-line interfaces.

Here are some key concepts to understand about GUIs:

* **Widgets**: A widget is a basic building block of a GUI. Examples of widgets include buttons, labels, text boxes, and menus.
* **Layout**: The layout of a GUI refers to the arrangement of widgets on the screen. This can be done using various layout managers such as grid, pack, and place.
* **Events**: Events are actions that occur when a user interacts with a GUI, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. GUIs use event handlers to respond to these events.

# GUI Example**

```python
import tkinter as tk

def create_widgets(master):
    # Button to display "Hello World" and print a message on click
    hi_there = tk.Button(master, text="Hello World\n(click me)", command=say_hi)
    hi_there.pack(side="top")
    
    # Button to quit the application
    quit_button = tk.Button(master, text="QUIT", fg="red", command=master.destroy)
    quit_button.pack(side="bottom")

def say_hi():
    print("hi there, everyone!")

# Create the main window
root = tk.Tk()

# Call the function to create widgets
create_widgets(root)

# Start the main event loop
root.mainloop()
```

# GUI Tips
* Always use a consistent layout and design for your GUI.
* Use meaningful and descriptive names for your widgets and variables.
* Handle events and errors properly.
* Use a GUI builder or IDE to simplify the process of building GUIs.

### Data Representation and Types

**Elaboration:**

Computers fundamentally store and process data as sequences of binary digits (0s and 1s). These binary sequences form the basis for all types of data a computer can handle. The concept of data types is crucial because it tells the computer how to interpret these binary sequences, whether as numbers, text, images, sound, or more complex structures like documents and videos. Here's a deeper look at how data representation and types are foundational and their relationship to the six fundamental operations and the problem-solving framework:

#### How Data Representation and Types Relate to the Six Fundamental Operations:

1. **Input:**
   - **Relevance:** When inputting data into a program, knowing the data type is essential for correctly interpreting and processing the input. For instance, user inputs are often strings that may need conversion to other types (e.g., integers or floats) for calculations.
   - **Example:** Reading a temperature input as a string and converting it to a float for further processing.

2. **Output:**
   - **Relevance:** When outputting data, the format and type must be considered to ensure the information is presented correctly. Different data types may require different formatting techniques.
   - **Example:** Displaying a temperature value with appropriate units (°C or °F) and ensuring it's correctly formatted as a number.

3. **Calculation:**
   - **Relevance:** Calculations require an understanding of numeric data types (integers, floats) to perform arithmetic operations accurately.
   - **Example:** Converting temperatures between different scales involves arithmetic operations on float values.

4. **Store/Assignment:**
   - **Relevance:** Storing data in variables requires assigning appropriate types to ensure correct manipulation and retrieval. Data types dictate the operations that can be performed on the stored data.
   - **Example:** Assigning a temperature reading to a float variable and later updating it based on new input.

5. **Make Decisions (If/Then):**
   - **Relevance:** Decision-making relies on Boolean expressions that often compare values of specific types. The result of these comparisons dictates the program’s flow.
   - **Example:** Checking if a temperature value exceeds a certain threshold to determine whether it's hot or cold.

6. **Going Loopy (for, while):**
   - **Relevance:** Iterating over collections of data (like lists or arrays) requires understanding the data type of elements being processed to apply appropriate operations.
   - **Example:** Looping through a list of temperature readings to find the highest value.

#### How Data Representation and Types Relate to the Problem-Solving Framework:

2. **Define Inputs and Outputs:**
   - **Importance:** Clearly defining data types for inputs and outputs ensures that the solution will handle data correctly and predictably.
   - **Example:** Specifying that input temperatures will be floats and output temperatures will be formatted strings.

3. **Work the Problem by Hand:**
   - **Importance:** Manually solving the problem with known data types helps in understanding the operations required and ensures the logical correctness of the approach.
   - **Example:** Manually converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, noting the arithmetic operations involved.

4. **Write Pseudo Code:**
   - **Importance:** Pseudo code helps in abstracting the problem and specifying data types without worrying about syntax, ensuring the logical flow is sound.
   - **Example:** Outlining steps for temperature conversion, including type conversion operations.

5. **Convert to Python Code:**
   - **Importance:** Translating pseudo code to Python involves explicitly defining and using data types correctly to implement the solution.
   - **Example:** Implementing the conversion algorithm with correct type handling in Python.

6. **Test with Data:**
   - **Importance:** Testing the program with various data types ensures that all edge cases and typical scenarios are handled correctly, confirming the robustness of the solution.
   - **Example:** Testing the temperature conversion function with a range of input values, ensuring accurate outputs.
