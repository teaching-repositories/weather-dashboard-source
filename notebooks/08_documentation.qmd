### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Install MkDocs and mkdocstrings:**

```{python}
!pip install mkdocs mkdocstrings mkdocstrings-python
```

2. **Initialize the MkDocs Project:**

```{python}
import os

# Change directory to the root of your overall project
os.chdir('..')

# Initialize a new MkDocs project in the root directory
!mkdocs new .

# Verify the current working directory (should be the root of your overall project)
os.getcwd()
```


3. **Update the mkdocs.yml Configuration:**

Create a new `mkdocs.yml` content to include the `mkdocstrings` plugin.

```{python}
# Create a new mkdocs.yml content
mkdocs_yml_content = """
site_name: My Project Documentation

nav:
    - Home: index.md

plugins:
    - search
    - mkdocstrings:
        handlers:
            python:
                setup_commands:
                    - pip install mkdocstrings-python

# Paths to the documentation files
docs_dir: docs
site_dir: site
"""

# Write the content to mkdocs.yml
with open('mkdocs.yml', 'w') as file:
    file.write(mkdocs_yml_content)
```

4. **Create the `index.md` Page:**

Include the module references directly in the `index.md`.

### index.md:

```{python}
index_md_content = """
# Welcome to My Project Documentation

This documentation covers the scripts used in the project.

## API Reference

### fetch_data

::: scripts.fetch_data

### process_data

::: scripts.process_data
"""

# Write the content to index.md
with open('docs/index.md', 'w') as file:
    file.write(index_md_content)
```

5. **Ensure `PYTHONPATH` is Set Correctly:**

To make sure MkDocs can find your `scripts` directory, set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

You can set the `PYTHONPATH` in the terminal or include it in the build command.

For example, in your terminal:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
```


```{python}
# Build the documentation with PYTHONPATH set
!mkdocs build

# Serve the documentation with PYTHONPATH set
!mkdocs serve
```

You can now access the documentation locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000.


### Summary

In this notebook, we learned how to:
- Install MkDocs, `mkdocstrings`, and `mkdocstrings-python`.
- Initialize an MkDocs project in the root of your overall project.
- Configure MkDocs to use `mkdocstrings` for auto-generating documentation.
- Directly include module references in the `index.md` file.
- Ensure the `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly so MkDocs can find your scripts.
- Build and serve the documentation locally.
